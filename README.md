# LearnFlow - AI-Powered Document Chat System

LearnFlow is an intelligent document chat system that allows users to upload PDF documents and have interactive conversations about their content. The system uses Google's Gemini AI for text generation and embeddings, combined with Pinecone for efficient vector storage and retrieval.

## Features

- ðŸš€ PDF Document Processing
  - Upload and process PDF documents
  - Automatic text extraction and chunking
  - Generate comprehensive document summaries
  - Store semantic embeddings for efficient retrieval

- ðŸ’¬ Interactive Chat
  - Ask questions about uploaded documents
  - Get context-aware responses
  - View chat history
  - Real-time processing

- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI
  - Clean and intuitive interface
  - Responsive design
  - Beautiful gradient animations
  - Loading states and error handling
